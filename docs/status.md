## 1. Summary of the Project

Our project will involve training an agent to navigate a environment filled with dangerous tripwire traps. It will be the agent's goal to navigate the environment safely which will involve jumping over the tripwire traps as necessary to escape. Using Malmo along with some Reinforcement Learning algorithms the agent will take in a state involving a coordinate as input and will produce an action response. The pool of actions currently includes, moving forward, jumping, and waiting. This pool may have more or fewer actions in the future as we learn what creative features we can implement in the agent's course.

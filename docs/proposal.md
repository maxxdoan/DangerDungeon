## 1. Summary of the Project

Our project will involve training an agent to navigate a environment filled with dangerous tripwire traps. It will be the agent's goal to navigate the environment safetly which will involve jumping over the tripwire traps as necessary to escape. Using Malmo along with some Reincorcment Learning algorithms the agent will take in the environment as input and will produce a traversal of the environment (successful or unsuccessful).

## 2. AI/ML Algorithms

We make our agent smart we will implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms like Q-learning in order for our agent to learn how to successful traverse the environment in front of them.

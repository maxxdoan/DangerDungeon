## 1. Summary of the Project

Our project will involve training an agent to navigate a environment filled with dangerous tripwire traps. It will be the agent's goal to navigate the environment safetly which will involve jumping over the tripwire traps as necessary to escape. The input will be the environment that needs to be traversed and will produce a traversal of the environment (successful or unsuccessful).
